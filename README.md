# PCA-for-Time-Series-Analysis

This project looks at tuberculosis prevalence over various countries between 1990-2007. PCA is applied over the dataset and then the first six PCAs are used to reconstruct the original data. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the incremental reconstruction of the data.
